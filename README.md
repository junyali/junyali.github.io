# junyali.github.io

A redesign of my personal website built with Vite and Tailwind CSS with Catppuccin colours :3

## Overview / What's new in the redesign

This is still a static website that serves as my personal website. There isn't really anything special but...

- Cooler design (catppuccin colour scheme, now with light mode switch!)
- Dedicated page to show my projects :p
- Better background effects
- RIP your browser performance because of how resource hungry this website is
- Tried using Tailwind CSS for most of styling and doing html elements in Typescript
- Redesigned gallery page from ground-up and used a CDN to host media
- There is also an easter egg üê∞ü•ö - can you find it? (it has multiple outcomes :eyes:)
